> This is a CSS theme to style subreddits. It was made for two purposes: to make a subreddit more new-user-friendly, and to give more visibility to the submit button.

> It is also ideal for subreddits that are not in English, since there's no hacky CSS injected text.


It's made up of a stylesheet and a sprite image.

It uses  most of Reddit's default font sizes, colors, and the silk icons collection, the same Reddit uses in several places.

The idea was to make a theme that doesn't clash with the frontpage, but tried to improve readability and general space division.

# How to use the sidebar code:

> A normal blockquote has this gray box.

> Any text that's continuously blockquoted shares the same box.

*****************************

> Separate blockquote groups with a horizontal line to make them different boxes.

*****************************

###### [](#h6-red)
> You can change a box's color by placing a specific empty header type right before making the blockquote.

> To make this box **red**, an empty **H6** element is used. The code looks like this:

>`###### [](#h6-red)`

>`> This is a box.`

********************************

##### [](#h5-yellow)
> To make a **yellow** box, use an empty **H5** element as we did before:

>`##### [](#h5-yellow)`

>`> This is a box`

********************************

#### [](#h4-green)
> To make a **green** box, use an empty **H4** element as we did before:

>`#### [](#h4-green)`

>`> This is a box`


*******************************

> #This is a title
> This box starts with an H1 element inside of it that serves as its header. Notice the indentation of all text contained in it.  

> `> #This is a title`

>`> This is a box`

**************************

###### [](#h6-red)
> #[Title with an icon](#icon-exclamation)
> This box starts with an H2 element, and has an icon. The icon is added to left of any sidebar element by linking it to a specific code:  

>`> ##[Title with an icon](#icon-exclamation)`

>`> This is a box`

> [A list of the icons available is available here](http://www.reddit.com/r/edurne/comments/zo5e4/icons_list/)


Normal text can be added after a separating horizontal line, and it will appear as it normally would. To add a box after this, just start a new blockquote.

**Remember**: horizontal lines are only needed when separating blockquote groups.


> # [Final Notes](#icon-information)
> You can play around making boxes within boxes or adding any markup withing these blockquote boxes.
